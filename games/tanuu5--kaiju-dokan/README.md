### Overall rating

Excluding the target itself, closest comparators are OUT OF THE BOX (54 overall / 68 screenshots: same author, similar stylized 3D toy, single focused loop), Kart Royale (50/70: complete polished 3D loop but single-track racer), OSRS Tower Defense (52/65: deep wave/tower systems with dense HUD), and moorestech (64/76: far broader factory/sim scope with denser systems). Kaiju Dokan shows a complete verified playable loop (block destruction physics, combos, energy/breath, AI waves, HP/regen, ranks, minimap, settings, headless balance sim) plus two coherent stylized 3D gameplay frames and three verified input schemes, placing it above single-loop kart racers and near OSRS Tower Defense, level with its prior 54 rating. Capped well below AAA: single stage (stage 2 pending), no verified performance/balance data, and stills cannot prove feel, difficulty, or long-term variety.

### Screenshot score

Two inspected gameplay frames show coherent stylized sunset-city 3D with dense lit-window blocks, kaiju model with glowing plates, debris/dust/breath effects, manga impact typography, and a full destruction-focused HUD. Slightly above OSRS Tower Defense (65) and scumm-game (62) on 3D scene density and effects, just below Kart Royale/Turbo Kart Rally/Neural Sight (70) on crispness and composition (dark crushed night blocks, HUD-less breath shot). Stills cannot prove motion, performance, or balance; title card discounted.

Inspected title card: KAIJU DOKAN! logo and Stage 1 bayside-city text over the same sunset procedural city, orange game-start button, mission text (40% destruction goal, defense-force warning) and control summary. Menu/title presentation of the game's own output, discounted as non-gameplay and listed last.

## Play

- Open https://tanuu5.github.io/kaiju-dokan/ in a WebGL2 browser (landscape recommended on phones).
- Reach the destruction-rate goal within the 4-minute limit to clear the stage, then keep rampaging or press Enter / pause-menu finish to see results.
- Move with WASD and Shift to dash (left stick / LB on gamepad; left-side touch drag, push to edge to dash); camera with mouse, arrow keys, right stick, or right-side touch drag.
- Attack with punch (left click / J / X), tail spin (E / K / B), jump stomp (Space / A), hold magma breath when charged (right click / F / L / RT), and roar (Q / I / Y).
- Chain destruction to raise the combo multiplier up to x5, charge energy to fire breath (glowing dorsal plates signal full charge), and smash tanks and helicopters while watching HP.
- On touch devices use the lower-right punch/jump/tail/breath/roar buttons and the top-left pause button; adjust quality, shake, sensitivity, and volumes in settings if the game is heavy.

## Mechanics

- Block-by-block building destruction with support-connectivity falling and tall-building sideways toppling with chain collisions
- Timed destruction-rate goal stage with score, ranks, toppled-building count, and post-clear score attack
- Destruction combo multiplier up to x5
- Energy meter charged by destruction enabling magma breath, with full-charge dorsal-glow signal
- AI defense forces (tanks, attack helicopters) escalating over time, vulnerable to all attacks plus roar stagger
- HP with damage-regen delay and heal-on-topple, game over at 0 HP
- Punch 3-hit slam, tail spin, jump stomp, charged breath, roar that scatters cars
- HUD with HP/energy/cooldowns, timer, destruction bar with goal marker, score, combo, and minimap
- Procedural city/sky/sea/shader visuals with sunset lighting, bloom, and stencil kaiju silhouette; synthesized Web Audio SFX and BGM
- Quality/shake/sensitivity/invert/volume/FPS settings with low-quality default on mobile

## Reconstructed prompt

Build KAIJU DOKAN, a 3D browser kaiju-destruction game in Three.js + TypeScript: play a giant monster smashing a procedural sunset bayside city with block-by-block building damage, support-collapse toppling with chain collisions, punch/tail/stomp/breath/roar attacks, combo multiplier, energy-charged magma breath, tanks and attack helicopters with HP/regen rules, 4-minute timed destruction-goal stage with score and ranks, minimap and full HUD, keyboard+mouse plus keyboard-only plus gamepad plus touch virtual-stick controls, quality/shake/sensitivity/volume settings, all graphics and Web Audio SFX/BGM generated in code, Vite+Vitest build with headless balance-simulation tests, deployable to GitHub Pages.

## Source evidence

- Live URL opens the actual playable game: HUD with Dokagon HP/energy, 4:00 timer, destruction rate vs goal, score, toppled-building count, control help (WASD/Shift/mouse/clicks/E/Space/breath/roar plus gamepad mapping), touch buttons, pause, settings, and stage-clear result — not just a repo or promo page. ([source](https://tanuu5.github.io/kaiju-dokan/))
- Repository is an actual game: repo title describes a 3D browser game where you control a giant kaiju to smash a city, built with Three.js + TypeScript; file listing shows src/, tests/, index.html, package.json, vite.config.ts, docs/images. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- README identifies the game as controlling giant kaiju Dokagon to destroy a sunset bayside city, with all graphics, sound effects, and BGM generated in code and no external image/audio files. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- README documents the win/lose loop: 4-minute limit, reach 40% destruction to clear the stage, keep rampaging for score after clearing, combo multiplier up to x5, energy charges magma breath, tanks and attack helicopters attack over time, HP reaches 0 for game over with regen rules. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- README documents keyboard+mouse controls (WASD, mouse camera, clicks, Space, E, Q, F), keyboard-only alternatives (J/K/L/I/arrows), and full gamepad mapping (sticks, X/B/A/RT/Y/START, menu navigation); live page confirms the same bindings. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- README documents smartphone/tablet touch controls: left-side drag spawns a virtual stick (push to edge to dash), right-side drag for camera, lower-right buttons for punch/tail/jump/breath/roar, pause button; live page shows the touch UI layer with the same buttons. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- No source mentions accelerometer/gyroscope motion controls, so motion support is unknown rather than ruled out. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- No multiplayer is documented; the game describes one player as the kaiju against AI defense forces (tanks, helicopters), so single-player with 1 human player. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- README attributes development to AI coding tool Claude Code with model Claude Opus 5.5. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- package.json declares three ^0.186.1 dependency with TypeScript ^7.0.2, vite ^8.3.1, vitest ^4.1.11 dev dependencies. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan/main/package.json))
- vite.config.ts confirms a Vite build targeting es2022 with relative base for GitHub Pages. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan/main/vite.config.ts))
- README technical section documents InstancedMesh block-based buildings with CPU destruction/support/toppling simulation, procedural shader windows/roads/sky/sea, sunset lighting with bloom, stencil see-through kaiju silhouette, and Web Audio synthesized SFX and drum-and-bass BGM loop. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- README operating-environment section requires a WebGL2-capable browser, establishing WebGL2 rendering. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))
- Existing catalog entry games/tanuu5--kaiju-dokan/README.md matches this repository and playable URL, so its slug is reused. ([source](https://github.com/tanuu5/kaiju-dokan))

## Fictional reviews

Treat these as illustrative, not real user reviews.

- 85/100: Fictional illustrative review: toppling a tower into its neighbor while the combo multiplier climbs is pure kaiju joy, and the sunset city looks great for fully code-generated art.
- 60/100: Fictional illustrative review: a fun four-minute rampage with a lot to learn; my first run was spent fumbling breath charges while tanks chipped away at my HP.
- 100/100: Fictional illustrative review: procedural city, manga impact text, breath beam over a burning skyline, plus touch stick, gamepad, and keyboard support — the most complete monster toy in the catalog.
