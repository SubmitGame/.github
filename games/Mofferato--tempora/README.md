### Overall rating

Tempora shows the deepest systems scope in the catalog: eleven eras, 22 lands, genetics, settlements, migrations, politics, wars, dynasties, three modes, autoplay and procedural music, verified through repository README layout tables and the src module list. Excluding the target itself, it sits above neverquest (45, the closest text-sim comparator but far narrower), THORNMERE (46) and The Nine Lives of Ash (47) on simulation breadth, and above OSRS Tower Defense (52) on historical/systems scope while below moorestech (64) because that game pairs deep systems with coherent 3D multiplayer execution, while Tempora is single-player text/DOM UI with no 3D scene, verified screenshots showing only panels and stat bars. Evidence gaps: no independent playtest of balance, performance, or long-run stability; headless sim harness claims exist but were not executed here; source-code findings are from inspected docs and raw files only, not a full clone.

### Screenshot score

Best frame (screenshot.png) is the game's own runtime output: coherent dark UI with character card, five stat bars, wealth readout, era timeline ribbon, tab bar, and dense year-by-year life log with color-coded stat chips. Polished typography and consistent orange/green accents place it above neverquest (30, monochrome dashboard), TypeScript-Blackjack (35, flat felt) and Top-10 Tension (32, flat quiz cards), and near 2048 (45) and The Nine Lives of Ash (50) on UI polish. It stays below Taipo (55, pixel-art scene), THORNMERE (60, textured retro scene with portrait), OSRS Tower Defense (65, dense 2D battlefield) and the catalog 70s (Kart Royale, Turbo Kart Rally, Neural Sight) because there is no rendered environment, lighting, character art beyond a flat avatar, or scene composition — only panels. World, profile and mobile frames confirm the same UI at lower density and are ordered later. Judged from stills only; no motion or feel inferred.

Inspected 1280x800 gameplay frame: ancient Egypt life view for Tiye of Buto, age 32, with left character card (avatar, home, status, Chief Blacksmith, five stat bars, deben wealth 1,049), era timeline ribbon on top, tab bar, and dense year-by-year life log for 418-419 BC with family events and green/red stat-change chips; orange Age +1 bar at bottom. Game's own runtime output.

Inspected 1280x800 gameplay frame: World tab showing settlement panel for a village near Memphis with settlement level, living-cost and wage multipliers, best-jobs note, and move buttons for Memphis and Thebes; same character card and Age bar. Game's own runtime output.

Inspected 1280x800 gameplay frame: character profile modal for Tiye of Buto with Overview/Stats/Personality/Life/Family/Achievements tabs and rows for age, birth, sex, nationality, class, education, occupation, relationship, children, wealth, personality and appearance. Game's own runtime output, partly overlaying the life log.

Inspected 780x1688 mobile frame: responsive phone layout of the same character card with stacked stat bars, wealth readout, and tab strip plus Age +1 button at bottom. Confirms small-screen layout; discounted toward graphics score as a layout variant rather than new scene detail.

## Source evidence

- Playable page at mofferato.github.io/tempora/ opens the actual game shell (Tempora header, era ribbon, Age +1 bar), not just a repo or promo page; title is 'Tempora: a life simulator across twelve thousand years'. ([source](https://mofferato.github.io/tempora/))
- Repository presents Tempora as a life simulator across twelve thousand years: born 10,000 BC to far future, living one year at a time in a world of dynasties, migrations, wars and politics; free, open source, one HTML file, MIT licensed. ([source](https://github.com/Mofferato/tempora))
- Play link points to https://mofferato.github.io/tempora/ with browser autosave; offline play by downloading index.html; platform server adds accounts and cloud saves. ([source](https://github.com/Mofferato/tempora))
- Features list documents eleven eras across 22 lands, living world with settlements/migrations/revolutions/wars, genetics, MBTI, class, fame, pets, school, careers, love/marriage, places, courts, wills, sports/Olympics, politics, era-appropriate communication, stat-change feedback, autoplay, Guide, optional Claude integration, dynasties, three modes (Narrative/Household/God), and procedural era music. ([source](https://github.com/Mofferato/tempora))
- Game is single-player life/dynasty play: live one year at a time and continue through children, relatives or anyone known; Community tab is profiles/posts, not multiplayer gameplay. ([source](https://github.com/Mofferato/tempora))
- UI is pointer/click driven with buttons and tabs; sound module listens to pointerdown and keydown to unlock audio; shell includes viewport-fit mobile meta; mobile screenshot shows responsive phone layout with the same Age flow. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mofferato/tempora/main/src/sound.js))
- No gamepad, accelerometer, gyroscope, or on-screen joystick documented; no explicit touch-control statement beyond tap-friendly browser UI and responsive layout. ([source](https://github.com/Mofferato/tempora))
- package.json declares the tempora package, homepage, MIT license, build/test/start scripts, and Node \>=18 engine requirement. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mofferato/tempora/main/package.json))
- build.js bundles ordered src/\*.js modules plus CSS and shell.html into a single self-contained index.html with zero install dependencies. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mofferato/tempora/main/build.js))
- sound.js synthesizes per-era music and effects with the Web Audio API and no audio files; first click unlocks audio. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mofferato/tempora/main/src/sound.js))
- Catalog match verified: existing directory games/Mofferato--tempora with same title, repository URL, and playable URL; this submission reuses that slug. ([source](https://github.com/Mofferato/tempora))
- gh api could not be used for GitHub evidence in this environment (gh auth missing, no GH\_TOKEN); GitHub evidence was verified via web fetch of repository and raw files instead. ([source](https://github.com/Mofferato/tempora))

## Fictional reviews

Treat these as illustrative, not real user reviews.

- 85/100: I started as a Natufian forager and died as an Egyptian blacksmith with three kids and a tax bill. Twelve thousand years of history kept moving without me and I could not stop pressing Age.
- 60/100: A fascinating dynasty machine buried in menus and stat bars. The systems run deep but evenings blur into the same loop of work, marry, age, inherit.
- 100/100: The most ambitious one-file life sim I have played. Eleven eras, real migrations, wars I could declare myself, then my granddaughter carried on. Nothing else does this.
