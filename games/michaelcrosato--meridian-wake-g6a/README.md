### Overall rating

Excluding the target itself, the closest comparators are moorestech (64 overall, catalog top with verified dense 3D factory systems, co-op, and years of iteration), LUMENRIFT (58, polished 3D action with 68-score screenshots), GunBros (57, complete twin-stick combat loop with 68-score screenshots), Kart Royale (50, complete polished single-loop 3D racer with 70-score screenshots), and SpaceHo2 (42, single-map 2D space 4X with AI rivals but unverified presentation). Meridian Wake sits above Kart Royale and SpaceHo2: it has a publicly reachable playable build, three inspected coherent gameplay frames with full HUDs, and documented end-to-end systems (694 systems, 351 hulls, large outfit catalog, Free Worlds campaign with endings, mining, boarding, escorts, autosave, CI/e2e, keyboard plus touch plus gamepad). It sits below moorestech because it is a single-day AI-generated adaptation with 0 stars, single-player only, no multiplayer/live-ops/modding evidence, and inventory counts alone cannot prove balance, performance at scale, or fun. Evidence gaps: no interactive playtest beyond loading the game shell and screenshots; combat balance, late-campaign depth, and sustained performance unverified.

### Screenshot score

Best gameplay frame (flight.png) is the game's own output: faceted low-poly planet, brick-built Sparrow and ring station, scattered asteroids, orbit lines, and a complete readable HUD with mission, credits, ship bars, action buttons, radar, and renderer telemetry. Coherent palette, clean composition, genuine scene detail. Against catalog calibration it sits just below Kart Royale/Turbo Kart Rally/Neural Sight (70, denser dynamic 3D or photographic scenes) and moorestech (76, densest HUD-heavy 3D), above OSRS Tower Defense (65, dense flat 2D) on 3D depth, and well above THORNMERE (60), Taipo (55), and flat DOM games (2048 45, Blackjack/Beachy 35, neverquest 30). Fleet and touch frames confirm real gameplay UI; title card discounted. Stills prove nothing about motion, performance, or balance.

## Play

- Open the playable build at https://meridian-wake-g6a.vercel.app/ in a current hardware-accelerated browser with WebGPU or WebGL2.
- Begin your voyage and choose the Sparrow, Shuttle, or Star Barge; a new captain replaces the local autosave, so export a backup first if needed.
- Read the first transmission at New Boston's spaceport and accept it.
- Depart, open the starmap with M, select the route, and jump; interstellar travel costs fuel and advances the day.
- Press L for assisted landing, then complete the mission at the port; pursue story and freelance trading, passenger, cargo, and mining work in parallel.
- Desktop: W/Up thrust, A/D or arrows rotate, S/Down brake, Space fire primary, F fire secondary, Shift boost, C cloak, M starmap, L land/launch, E ship operations, B board, G harvest fuel, R survey/scan, J journal, I equipment/cargo, Esc pause. Touch screens use on-screen steering, thrust, brake, boost, fire, and cloak controls; standard gamepads are also supported with remapping in Options.

## Mechanics

- Top-down inertial 3D spaceflight with thrust, rotation, braking, boosting, assisted landing, and autopilot landing approach
- Open-world trading in commodities plus passenger and cargo contracts with deadlines, fuel costs, and day advancement
- Bank loan, crew costs, fuel/repair, banking, shipyards, outfitters, and fleet/escort services at ports
- Combat with primary and secondary weapons, finite ammunition, point defense, energy/heat management, cloaking, boarding and capturing disabled ships, and persistent hulks/wrecks
- Asteroid mining with finite extraction and cooldowns, mineral cargo sales, and salvage
- Ship ownership progression across 351 base hulls and a large outfit catalog with cargo, bunk, engine, scanner, cloak, Jump Drive, and expedition-gated equipment
- Free Worlds branching campaign with mutually exclusive routes, protected convoys, reconnaissance, diplomacy, timed evasion missions, and an earned ending with continued sandbox play
- Galaxy traversal across 694 systems with starmap route planning, directed wormholes, gas-giant, stellar-garden, ringworld, and station locations
- Local autosave with JSON save export/import, volume/mute/fullscreen options, diagnostics, handbook, and quality presets

## Source evidence

- Repository michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a is public, not a fork, described as a brick-built 3D browser reimagining of Endless Sky with Vite, Three.js WebGPU/WebGL2 and Rapier, generated 2026-09-26 with GPT-6 Astra; homepage points to the Vercel deployment and primary language is JavaScript. ([source](https://api.github.com/repos/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a))
- README titles the game Meridian Wake, attributes generation to GPT-6 Astra (g6a) on 26 September 2026, and describes trading, passengers, mining, ship equipment, escorts, and the Free Worlds story in a 3D browser adaptation of Endless Sky. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/README.md))
- README documents keyboard controls (W/arrows thrust, A/D turn, S brake, Space primary, F secondary, Shift boost, L land/launch, M map, E operations, B board, G scoop fuel, R scan, C cloak, T contacts, J journal, I equipment, Esc pause), establishing keyboard support. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/README.md))
- README states the same game is available through keyboard, touch and standard gamepads, and compatibility docs state keyboard, remapped controls, simultaneous touch and standard gamepads are supported, establishing gamepad support. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/docs/compatibility.md))
- README and handbook describe simultaneous touch steering, thrust, brake, boost, primary/secondary fire and cloak controls with portrait and landscape layouts, and the inspected touch-landscape frame shows on-screen steering, thrust, fire and boost buttons, establishing mobile touch support. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/README.md))
- No accelerometer, gyroscope, or device-motion controls are documented in the README or compatibility docs; motion support is unestablished rather than explicitly ruled out. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/docs/compatibility.md))
- Progress autosaves in browser storage as a single captain where a new captain replaces the save, with JSON export/import and no multiplayer, lobby, or netcode documented, establishing single-player with one human player. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/README.md))
- package.json pins three 0.186.1, @dimforge/rapier3d-compat 0.21.0, vite 8.3.1 and @playwright/test 1.63.0, establishing engine, physics, and build versions. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/package.json))
- README rendering section documents Three.js WebGPU with WebGL2 fallback, node materials, bloom/AO, automatic quality selection, and fixed-step Rapier simulation with interpolation. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/README.md))
- Content docs pin Endless Sky data, describe 694 systems, 2344 native mission declarations, 351 base hull names, a large outfit catalog, Free Worlds Reconciliation/Checkmate paths plus sandbox, and authored wiki side stories; counts describe inventory, not proof every script is playable. ([source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a/main/docs/content.md))
- Deployed homepage returns the game shell with scene/app mounts, MERIDIAN WAKE loading text, and game bundles for universe, render-engine, and physics-engine, verifying a publicly reachable playable URL. ([source](https://meridian-wake-g6a.vercel.app))
- Existing catalog directory games/michaelcrosato--meridian-wake-g6a matches this repository and playable URL exactly, so the existing slug is reused; it was identified by repository and deployment match, not title alone. ([source](https://github.com/michaelcrosato/meridian-wake-g6a))

## Fictional reviews

Treat these as illustrative, not real user reviews.

- 82/100: Fictional review: I ran the first passenger contract from New Boston exactly as the handbook says, and the loop clicked — launch, plot, jump, assisted landing, payday. The brick-built ships give every system real charm.
- 64/100: Fictional review: Huge galaxy and loads of outfits to chase, but I spent more time reading journals and starmaps than dogfighting. A thoughtful trader's space game rather than an arcade rush.
- 95/100: Fictional review: A one-person loan, a tiny Sparrow, and hundreds of star systems of possibility — the Free Worlds story threading through trading, mining, and boarding is the most ambitious browser voyage I have seen this year.
