### Overall rating

Far from AAA (no 3D, voice, cinematics, multiplayer) but a complete real-time arcade loop with unusually broad systems: 4-lane cooking/serving/plate-catching, 8 customer variants, 10 power-ups, bosses, UFO/raids, store economy, workers, death replay and Supabase leaderboard across ~160 tracked files with tests. Most relevant comparators: neverquest (45, deeper RPG systems but text-UI only), Wilderness (44, similar scope tier), SpaceHo2 (42) and Turbo Kart Rally (40, complete indie loop but single-track/simple systems) - Pizza Chef sits with Wilderness just below neverquest/THORNMERE (46) because visual polish is unverified (only empty background, How-to-Play card and icon inspected, no full gameplay frame with entities/HUD), and below catalog-top Ashlands (55) and Kart Royale (50) on technical ambition and proven rendering. Above 2048 (38), Taipo (35) and Blackjack (28) on depth and scope. Evidence gaps: no live playthrough; playability, performance, balance and mobile feel judged from code and docs only, not motion.

### Screenshot score

No inspectable gameplay screenshot.

## Fictional reviews

Treat these as illustrative, not real user reviews.

- 85/100: Four ovens beeping, plates flying, a critic with a monocle bearing down - brilliant lunch-rush panic with real upgrade strategy.
- 62/100: Fun core loop and wild power-ups, but I want to see a full crowded rush in action before I chase the leaderboard.
- 100/100: Pizza Mafia burst saved my run and the Nyan sweep cleared the screen - instant arcade classic!
