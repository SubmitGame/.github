# AwesomeClaude instructions

## AgentsWeb runner testing

For SSH requests here, use the live AgentsWeb Actions runner and `~/.ssh/aiplay-agentsweb`; use `a2` only if named. Verify SSH before editing runner YAML.

## Issue catalog workflow

Open a real test issue automatically after changing the issue catalog workflow. Post the banner, 10–30-minute estimate, and Actions link before analysis. Merge eligible catalog branches directly by default; create an open PR only when manual merge is enabled. Publish the commit, manual PR, or recovery branch and the issue report, including branch README links for added games, before the owner-only 30-minute SSH hold. Keep the same worker and tunnel alive during the hold, including after analysis or publication failure. Skip the hold for non-owner issues. During analysis, SSH into the issue worker; inspect OpenCode records, logs, and processes; and assess progress directly. Report publication and issue-comment links as soon as they appear. Do not wait for the idle period to finish.

Use the [game discovery dataset](/Users/igor/Documents/Codex/2026-09-08/find-games-last-week-made-with/games.json) as a candidate-game reference. Verify entries before adding them to the catalog.

## OpenCode source

Use the local OpenCode source checkout at `../ChatGPT/opencode`. Refer to [the upstream repository](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) for its GitHub page.

## OpenCode test links

Copy every live OpenCode session URL printed by `scripts/test-oc.sh` immediately into a visible chat response as a clickable Markdown link. Include every run link again in the final response. Return after launch; inspect per-run `result.json` only when asked for outcomes.

## Verification

- Don't write or run unit tests, mock tests, or static analysis.
- Don't use mockups instead of a real end-to-end run.
- Don't ask the user to test or analyze; do it directly.
- Don't finish without running and analyzing the end-to-end flow.
